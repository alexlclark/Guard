Every using junky also wants more heroin. Call it a contradiction call it what you want. But no junky wants the life they have.",

        "wholeQuote":"I woke up last week to the radio playing quietly. I got ready for the trek to the other end of the house to wake up the kid. The 7:30am news came on. I was still sleepy. â€œThe actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman is dead.â€ I was only half listening. I'd seen his work but have never been one to pay much attention to famous personalities or celebrities. â€œHe was forty-six.â€ That caught half my attention â€“ the same age as me. â€œFrom a heroin overdose.â€ There I was, sitting on the edge of my bed with a syringe full of heroin in my hand. All at once I felt a kindred with someone I had never known. I knew a couple of characters he'd played, I knew his name, but that was it. Now suddenly, he was a lot like me.When you're addicted to heroin, It\'s generally a long-running, close relationship.  There are plenty of bad times, but there are also gems that stay with you. It\'s like family â€“ a parent, sibling or child. You may swear that for all they've put you through, you never want anything to do with them again, but there's always that part of you that misses the good times and wonders how you'd get along now. When I first gave up heroin, I could never tell myself it was forever. I could not imagine never entering that cosy cocoon again.",

Hearing about Hoffman affects me the same way as if it were a friend. I didnt know he was an addict untill he died, but when I heard of his story and addiction I immediatly identified with him. We work the same way in our minds. I know what happened to him before he picked up. I know how he felt. I'm pretty sure it started the same way most relapses do. ",
